# Orientis Strong viewer
Tracking progress is an important part of any gym routine. The Strong app is great for logging workout sets, but its built-in progress charts can be hard to read. With this web app, you can export your workout data from Strong and import it here to get clearer, more insightful visualizations of your progress.

## Using the App

1. In the **Strong app** (version 6), export your workout history as a CSV file.
